# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Introduction

This project aims to compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers, specifically K-NN, SVM, and Neural Networks, to predict whether a patient has diabetes. The prediction is based on several independent variables including Cholesterol, Smoking Habits, Sex, BMI, Income, and Age.

# Data Description 
## BRFSS Dataset:
The BRFSS notebook primarily follows a structured approach with steps like importing libraries and dataset, data visualization, and data preprocessing. 

## Pima Indians Dataset:

The dataset consists of 768 records and 9 features.
Each feature can be of integer or float datatype. 
Some features like Glucose, Blood pressure, Insulin, and BMI have zero values which represent missing data. 
There are no NaN values in the dataset.
The outcome column represents diabetes status, where 1 is diabetes positive and 0 is diabetes negative.
The dataset is imbalanced, with more patients without diabetes than those with it.
A high correlation is observed between the Outcome and features like Glucose, BMI, Age, and Insulin.

# Models Used: 
Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network.
